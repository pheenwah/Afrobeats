          <h2>What is Afrobeats?</h2>
          <p>
            Afrobeat is a music genre that fuses African music with Black
            American influences to produce a compelling hybrid of culture and
            sound. The genre is largely the creation of Nigerian artist Fela
            Kuti who, with his band Africa 70, forged a rhythmic mix of West
            African beats (predominantly Nigerian and Ghanaian) and American
            jazz,
            <a href="https://www.masterclass.com/articles/soul-music-guide"
              >soul</a
            >, and
            <a href="https://www.masterclass.com/articles/funk-music-guide"
              >funk</a
            >, which was shot through with a potent streak of political
            awareness. Kuti’s music lit the fuse for Afrobeat, and the torch was
            carried forward by a mix of African artists, like Kuti’s former
            drummer, Tony Allen. In the West, performers Brian Eno and David
            Byrne from The Talking Heads drew on Afrobeat for their
            groundbreaking album Remain in Light (1980). Listeners can still
            hear Kuti’s influence in the music of his sons, Femi Kuti and Seun
            Kuti, and modern Western bands like the Grammy-winning Antibalas.
            Afrobeat music is frequently labeled as Afrobeats, an umbrella term
            for a far-ranging music scene from West Africa and the United
            Kingdom, which incorporates many popular music styles. The two
            sounds share only a common heritage.

          <h2>History of Afrobeats</h2>
          <p>
            The history of Afrobeat began in the early twentieth century when
            musicians from Ghana combined West African regional music with
            Western jazz and calypso. The resulting new sound became known as
            highlife, which continued to fold additional Western influences into
            its heady mix over the next few decades.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Kuti and Africa 70 carve out the sound: Nigerian musician Fela
              Aníkúlápó-Kuti, who began his career playing in an array of
              African highlife and jazz bands, absorbed the sounds of soul,
              jazz, soca, and rhythm and blues during various tours of America
              and the United Kingdom. He then unleashed this formidable creation
              in his band, Nigeria 70 (later Africa 70), debuting his unique new
              musical style in the early 1970s.
            </li>
            <li>
              Development of the core sound and politics: With their debut
              album, Zombie, Kuti and Africa 70 established the core sound of
              Afrobeat, which freely mixed jazz and highlife with the epic funk
              of James Brown, reggae and Caribbean rhythm, and psychedelic rock.
              Kuti sang over tracks in English and Yoruba, leading the band on
              saxophone, keyboards, and other instruments. He also lent Afrobeat
              a political side by criticizing the human rights records of
              Nigeria and the United States on record and in his marathon live
              performances.
            </li>
            <li>
              Continuation under Egypt 80: Kuti remained a major artist in
              Africa and abroad until his death in 1997; his son Seun renamed
              the band Egypt 80 and continued to record and perform, as did
              Seun’s brother, Femi, who enjoyed a degree of popularity similar
              to that of his father.
            </li>
            <li>
              Afrofunk is born: The most successful figure from Kuti’s orbit was
              undoubtedly drummer Tony Allen, who expanded on the Afrobeat sound
              by mixing in elements of hip-hop, dub, and electronica to form a
              new subgenre called Afrofunk. Allen enjoyed even wider exposure
              than his former bandleader through collaborations with Air, Zap
              Mama, and Damon Albarn of Blur, among others.
            </li>
            <li>
              Crossover influence: The work of Fela Kuti and Allen was the
              bedrock of Afrobeat, but jazz musicians like Roy Ayers also
              recorded Afrobeat-inspired music in the 1970s. Ayers toured
              Nigeria with the elder Kuti in the late ’70s. Contemporary artists
              like Antibalas and Zongo Junction—both hailing from Brooklyn, New
              York— have carved careers out of the Afrobeat sound. Mainstream
              rock and soul bands, like TV on the Radio and the Budos Band, have
              also recorded songs with an Afrobeat flavor.

          <h2>The Impact of Afrobeats</h2>
          <h3>The distinct difference between Afrobeat and Afrobeats</h3>
          <p>
            Most people confuse Afrobeat and Afrobeats but don’t know that the
            two are predominantly distinct in sound and genre. Music historians
            have traced origin sounds of Afrobeat in Ghana and Nigeria as early
            as the 1920s but most people would mark the birth of the genre to
            the 1960s. As it morphed into a looser style called Afrobeats, it
            became the No. 1 genre of popular music in the African continent for
            the past decade — and thanks to support from major American
            superstars and killer moves created by African dancers, it has
            invaded the U.S. as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The name is kind of elusive and people get confused by it. I don’t
            even think just people who are not African get confused by it; I
            think Africans are also confused by the name. It’s always been
            contention around the name Afrobeats in general. Some people within
            the culture don’t even like the name Afrobeats. They don’t think
            it’s a proper descriptive of the sound. They think that it was just
            a name that people made in the U.K. and it stuck,” culture
            journalist Ivie Ani told REVOLT. “Afrobeats is the name people chose
            to go with and it is very different from Afrobeat.” She added,
            “People should look at Afrobeat as the genre that came way before
            Afrobeats. Afrobeats is more so an amalgamation of Afrobeat, hip
            hop, dancehall, all of the older sounds that we see in Nigeria and
            Ghana like Highlife and Fuji.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Afrobeat puts together American influences like jazz and funk and
            combines them with elements of West African musical styles. For
            example, you can hear the strains of so-called Fuji music in the
            genre. Fuji hails from Nigeria and has roots to the music that was
            performed to wake Muslims during their holy month of Ramadan.
            Another common element in Afrobeat is Highlife music, a Ghanaian
            genre characterized by jazzy horns and multiple guitars. In more
            recent years, Afrobeat morphed into Afrobeats and simply became the
            new sound of Africa. It has diverse influences that take inspiration
            from its African roots and are combined with other music genres such
            as rap, reggae, dancehall, R&B, and hiplife, a musical style that
            Ghanaians identify as hip hop with a more modern expression.
          </p>
          <p>
            When speaking about the two genres, Ani revealed a common issue that
            arises and makes it a lot more difficult for people to differentiate
            the words Afrobeat and Afrobeats tonally. “When we’re talking about
            people with West African accents, often times we tend to drop the s
            after things. You see it a lot in the Caribbean as well,” she
            explained. “For example, the word ‘artists’ — someone might be
            referring to the plural version of artist, but they’re dropping the
            s because of their accent, so they’ll say artist instead of artists.
            That happens a lot with the word Afrobeats. They’re saying Afrobeat
            referring to the newer genre Afrobeats, but with their accent, and
            tone and the way we speak, the s sometimes gets dropped and then you
            hear them say Afrobeat, but they’re not talking about Afrobeat. I
            think that is something that people don’t consider.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Nigerian singer 2Baba, who is known as one of the biggest pioneers
            of Afrobeats, agreed that there is a huge space between the old and
            new school music artists across Africa. “Most of the sounds, ideas,
            philosophy, and even the mannerisms in them were very common and
            present in the old school sounds, but I think Fela was ahead of his
            time in so many ways and embodied this the most so naturally that
            the young minds gravitated towards him more in every aspect, and it
            was just a no brainer to accept the sound as Afrobeats,” he said.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though it started in Africa and remains more popular and dominant
            there than any other kind of music, Afrobeats is not a one-continent
            phenomenon. It has been adopted around the world and has gained a
            constant presence on the radio, on TV, in award show categories,
            social media, and even in nightclubs around the world. Many West
            African artists have developed global audiences with their hits
            charting in multiple countries.
          </p>
          <h3>
            From Nigeria to the world: Afrobeats is having a global moment
          </h3>
          <p>
            Another Grammy Awards season and there is a growing list of African
            nominees. For African music enthusiasts, it is heartwarming that
            recognition is being accorded to practitioners in the Afrobeats
            space.
          </p>
          <p>
            Afrobeat and Afrobeats, although related, are quite distinct.
            Afrobeats is the genre that emerged when West African pop music
            became cool. Its origins coincide with the media liberalisation that
            accompanied the “final” wave of democratisation in Africa from 1999.
            More than this, it is a convenient term for Europe to refer to music
            coming out of Africa, distinct from Euro-American pop.
          </p>
          <p>
            Afrobeat, on the other hand, is what Nigerian music icon Fela
            Anikulapo-Kuti called his invention, which blended jazz, funk,
            psychedelic rock and traditional West African chant and rhythms in
            the early 1970s. Afrobeat typically bears messages of liberation.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a relationship between Afrobeats and Afrobeat; indeed, an
            overlap between Fela’s music, lifestyle and message and today’s
            Afrobeats practice.

          <h2>Leading Afrobeats Artists Today</h2>
          <p>
            Earlier this month, Selena Gomez posted a photo of herself and
            Nigerian singer Rema on Instagram, captioned: “This man has changed
            my life forever. Rema, thank you for choosing me to be a part of one
            of the biggest songs in the world. Love you forever.” You have
            definitely heard the song in question—’Calm Down‘. With over 500
            million views on YouTube, the track’s success is not a one-off
            phenomenon, but part of a more significant, growing trend. Steadily
            climbing the charts and solidifying itself in the public
            consciousness is a unique music genre: Afrobeats.
          </p>
          <p>
            If that name doesn’t immediately sound familiar, you may have been
            jamming to Afrobeats tunes without even realising their roots. Think
            ‘One Dance’ by Drake, Wizkid, and Kyla, or ‘For My Hand’ by Burna
            Boy, featuring Ed Sheeran. If you enjoyed Black Panther: Wakanda
            Forever and Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, you would know how
            much each film’s soundtrack added to its overall impact—all thanks
            to the lineup of Afrobeats artists featured.
          </p>
          <p>
            Originating in West Africa as well as the diaspora in Nigeria, Ghana
            and the United Kingdom, Afrobeats is a synthesis of sounds
            identified by notable percussion, chanting vocals and elaborate
            overlapping rhythms. Initially, the genre found popularity in the
            regions of its origin, until DJ Abrantee coined the name ‘Afrobeats’
            in the early 2010s and debuted the first Afrobeats show on UK radio,
            putting it on the world map.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the past few years, powerhouses like Burna Boy, Wizkid and
            Davido have caught the attention of listeners outside of Africa with
            their unique sound. Their music seamlessly integrates elements we
            know and love: dancehall, rap, reggae, pop and R&B. With their
            versatile and infectious beats, it is no surprise that these tracks
            have also shaped up to be viral hits on social media.
          </p>
          <p>
            After CKay’s ‘love nwantiti (ah ah ah)’ exploded in popularity on
            TikTok and climbed the Billboard charts, the publication created a
            dedicated chart for Afrobeats in 2022. “I can remember when it
            wasn’t cool to be from Africa—people would lie and say they were
            Jamaican,” Afrobeats musician Davido notes in an interview with
            Forbes. “Now we have our own Billboard charts in the US and UK—that
            shows how serious the Western world is taking our music.” With the
            genre being embraced internationally, get acquainted with the top
            musicians rising in the Afrobeats realm below.

            <h3><li class="leading-artist-names">Burna Boy</li></h3>
            <img
              src="https://voguesg.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/28161125/Burna-Boy.jpg"
              alt="Photo of Burna Boy"
              class="leading-artists"
            />
            <p>
              Dubbed the ‘African Giant’ for his massive cultural impact in
              bringing Afrobeats into the mainstream, Burna Boy is one of the
              biggest names on the scene. His latest album, Love, Damini, is
              star-studded, with collaborators like Ed Sheeran, Kehlani, J
              Balvin and Khalid. His solo tracks shine as well: ‘Kilometre’,
              ‘Last Last’, and ‘It’s Plenty’ are must-listens in our book.
            </p>
            <h3><li class="leading-artist-names">Amaarae</li></h3>
            <img

              alt="Photo of Amaarae"
              class="leading-artists"
            />
            <p>
              You may have heard Amaarae’s distinctive, dreamy voice all over
              the internet on her track ‘Sad Girlz Luv Money’, which was later
              remixed with Kali Uchis. Equally hypnotising is ‘Reckless &
              Sweet’, which can be found on her latest album Fountain Baby.
            </p>
            <h3><li class="leading-artist-names">Rema</li></h3>
            <img

              alt="Photo of Rema"
              class="leading-artists"
            />
            <p>
              Rema needs no introduction. The 23-year-old’s debut album Rave &
              Roses not only presented the world with chart-topper ‘Calm Down’,
              but also the incredibly danceable ‘Soundgasm’ and ‘Charm’.
            </p>
            <h3><li class="leading-artist-names">Ayra Starr</li></h3>
            <img
              src="https://voguesg.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/31171245/Ayra-Starr-1.jpg"
              alt="Photo of Ayra Starr"
              class="leading-artists"
            />
            <p>
              At only 19 years old, emerging Afrobeats star Ayra Starr was
              catapulted to fame following the release of her album, 19 &
              Dangerous. Her debut single ‘Rush’ went viral in 2021, as did
              ‘Sability’ this year, each spurring its own TikTok dance
              challenge.
            </p>
            <h3><li class="leading-artist-names">Wizkid</li></h3>
            <img

              alt="Photo of Wizkid"
              class="leading-artists"
            />
            <p>
              Be it on the Justin Bieber’s ‘Essence’ or Beyoncé’s ‘Brown Skin
              Girl’, Wizkid’s sound is unmissable in any track he features on.
              Most recently, he made his mark on the Spider-Man: Across the
              Spider-Verse soundtrack with ‘Link Up’.
            </p>
            <h3><li class="leading-artist-names">Tems</li></h3>
            <img
              src="https://voguesg.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/28161931/Tems.jpg"
              alt="Photo of Tems"
              class="leading-artists"
            />
            <p>
              Nigerian singer and songwriter Tems clinched the ‘Best Melodic Rap
              Performance’ Grammy in 2023 for her collaboration on ‘Wait For U’
              with rappers Future and Drake. Spot her heartfelt song ‘No Woman
              No Cry’ alongside a lineup of fellow Afrobeats artists on the
              Black Panther: Wakanda Forever soundtrack.
            </p>
            <h3><li class="leading-artist-names">Fireboy DML</li></h3>
            <img
              src="https://voguesg.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/28162659/Fireboy-DML.jpg"
              alt="Photo of Fireboy DML"
              class="leading-artists"
            />
            <p>
              It’s hard not to dance whenever a Fireboy DML track plays. Known
              for his biggest hit with Ed Sheeran, ‘Peru’, Fireboy DML’s
              discography also includes the R&B-cum-Afrobeats song ‘Playboy’ and
              his most recent release ‘Yawa’.
